With so many free, open source game engines and tutorials available online, there’s never been an easier (or more exciting!) time to try out game development.

Are you…

1) Into JavaScript? You might be interested in Phaser.
2) Comfortable with  C++ or C#? Look at  Godot, Unity and Unreal Engine.
3) Proficient with Python? Check out Pygame or  Godot (Godot uses GDScript, which is similar to Python).
4) Dangerous with Java? Take a look at libGDX.
5) In love with Lua? Check out LÖVE or Defold.  
      Like retro games too? Drop everything and check out LIKO-12!

1) Hack on a Roguelike dungeon crawler in JavaScript or Haskell.
2) Crank out a text adventure in or some interactive fiction with Clojure or Ink (similar to Markdown).
3) Craft that 8-bit console game you always fantasized about with PICO-8, Pixel Vision 8, TIC-80 (Lua), BASIC8 (Basic), or Pyxel (Python).
